* Flexibility and scalability in SQL databases by implementing UpdatableSerialazable.
* Automate your IDE, workspace or standarize a naming convention within files in your community with NamingConventions.
* Go anarch mode and use Result<T> instead of Optional<T>. Explain your fellows it's for selfexplanatorism!
* Let 'Variable should be final or effectively final' bury. Fetch an Uber<T>, talk(T t) in order to update the address and remember to tip!
* We (currently he/him) added Tuple's of 2, 3 and 4!

######For the not so humble users ðŸ¤¨
* If JOptionPane is not enough in your Programming 101 assignments, I made a mini library/framework. Go checkout AnjoPane/AnjoComponent.
* If you cannot download more ram in your toaster, I made a wrapper for SQL databases.

######For the monkes big money investor ðŸ’µ
* If you want to do CRUD operations in SQL, I made SQLCrudManager. Go check both SQLiteCrudManager and MySQLCrudManager
